# Minesweeper Mania: The Minesweeper Solver
## FinalProject-OOP
### Mia Weber & Brandon Kamplain
The game Minesweeper is a quintessential puzzle game that challenges players to uncover a minefield without revealing explosives, guided only by numerical clues. This project is centered around a strict Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design approach to algorithmically solve Minesweeper. The solver intelligently navigates the grid, relying on the algorithm to make logical decisions and safely reveal empty spaces. The algorithm was designed with efficiency and optimization in mind and leverages pattern recognition and logical deduction to make informed decisions, ensuring the game is solved without resorting to guessing. The final product provides a visual, interactive platform, that illustrates the algorithm’s decision-making processes in real-time and allows users to place the explosives on the grid themselves. The implications of this project extend beyond classic computer games, providing an opportunity to investigate the power of algorithmic logic in complex decision-making. Future investigations could use this project as a training set for more advanced machine-learning algorithms.

### Technical Requirements:
* Must use Object-Oriented Principles and Design 
* Must use at least 3 design patterns (see textbook or https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/  ) 
  * Explicitly discuss/present the design patterns you’ve picked and why; why they’re useful in solving your problem 
* Must use CI-CD and git best practices as shown in - https://github.com/rambasnet/course-container  
* Must use unittesting (mocking/patching) and property-based testing using hypothesis 
* Must produce design documentation of the product such as UML diagrams, API and Cod documentation, etc. 
* Must use a software management tool (e.g., GitHub Project, Clickup, MS Teams, etc.) 
* Must document each member’s responsibility for various parts of the projects
  * can use Gant chart, kanban board, etc.

### How to Run

### Prerequisites

Before running the Minesweeper solver, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/))
- Pygame library ([Pygame Official Website](https://www.pygame.org/))

### Installation

1. Clone the Minesweeper solver repository from GitHub:
git clone <repository_url>

2. Navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository:
cd <repository_directory>
3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt
### Running the Program

To run the Minesweeper solver, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the Minesweeper solver files.

3. Run the following command, replacing `<width>`, `<height>`, and `<mines>` with your desired values:
python minesweeper_solver.py <width> <height> <mines>

Example:
python minesweeper_solver.py 10 10 15

This command will launch the Minesweeper solver with the specified dimensions and number of mines.
