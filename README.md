# Minesweeper Mania: The Minesweeper Solver
## FinalProject-OOP
### Mia Weber & Brandon Kamplain
The game Minesweeper is a quintessential puzzle game that challenges players to uncover a minefield without revealing explosives, guided only by numerical clues. This project is centered around a strict Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design approach to algorithmically solve Minesweeper. The solver intelligently navigates the grid, relying on the algorithm to make logical decisions and safely reveal empty spaces. The algorithm was designed with efficiency and optimization in mind and leverages pattern recognition and logical deduction to make informed decisions, ensuring the game is solved without resorting to guessing. The final product provides a visual, interactive platform, that illustrates the algorithmâ€™s decision-making processes in real-time and allows users to place the explosives on the grid themselves. The implications of this project extend beyond classic computer games, providing an opportunity to investigate the power of algorithmic logic in complex decision-making. Future investigations could use this project as a training set for more advanced machine-learning algorithms.
